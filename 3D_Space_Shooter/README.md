# GameDevJourney

This game is part of a personal project to build 3 games in 3 engines covering a wide variety of mechanics to learn as much about game development as possible in a few months.

I spent 30 days working on the game aiming for at least 30 minutes per day. Overall I spent around 35 to 40 hours on the game.

The focus of this game was learning to use Unreal Engine 5 and developing a game with 3D movement and some sort of enemy AI.

The game is not particularly fun to play and I definitely wouldn't recommend it to anyone, but I'm considering it a major success because it's the first time I've finished a game and my first time using Unreal.

The game is avalible on [itch.io](https://thisisrob.itch.io/just-a-space-shooter)
